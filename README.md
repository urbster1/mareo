INTRODUCTION
============

MAREO, spanish for ‘dizziness’, is a special program for CD rippers and other audio compression frontends that has the ability to execute multiple encoders for each track ripped, allowing to encode to multiple audio formats at the same time.

It can be used to rip to FLAC (for archival) and MP3 (for MP3 Player use) at once, or to WavPack and Ogg Vorbis, or to Monkey’s Audio and AAC, etc.

MAREO is also capable of handling “multi-file-generator” encoders, like
